Neuromuscular Therapy is used for clients with chronic pain as it can **reduce** or even **eliminate** persistent _painful conditions_. Many techniques can also be used to treat **acute injuries** and **post-surgical care**. Some clients even use this therapy to help to **improve performance** in _sport_ or _dance_ and to **prevent injuries** due to these activities.

Neuromuscular Therapy treatment starts with a complete examination of pain and dysfunction throughout the body which may include client history and functional testing. It is then followed by bodywork treatment that is specific to your treatment plan.
