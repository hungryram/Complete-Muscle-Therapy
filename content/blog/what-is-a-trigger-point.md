Trigger Points are firm nodules that you can often feel in your tight, rope-like muscles. Pressing on a Trigger Point hurts in the area and also shoots pain to other regions, while pressing on just a Tender Point is believed to only cause discomfort to the local area.

\**********************************

Trigger Points can be a factor or cause of common conditions such as...

👉🏼 Migraines/Tension Headaches

👉🏼 Neck/Ear/Jaw Pain

👉🏼 Burning Between Shoulders

👉🏼 Thoracic Outlet Syndrome

👉🏼 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

👉🏼 Tennis Elbow

👉🏼 Sinus Pain & Congestion

👉🏼 Arm & Hand Pain

👉🏼 Etc!

.

The importance of understanding your body and NOT ignoring pain is crucial as it can lead to other injuries.

✨Bodywork is not just a luxury, it is a holistic way of managing & taking care of your body.
